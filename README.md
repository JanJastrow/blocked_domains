# blocked_domains
My personal blocklist of domains for DNS based blocking (in my usecase #PiHole).

From time to time I'll add (malicious) domains that I stumple upon.

## Description

- malicious.txt -- domains that where involved in shady things (redirects, spam, scam, etc.)
- ad_tracking.txt -- tracking or ad-serving domains
- bigcompanies.txt -- domains of big companies that I don't want on my network (update blocking or similar)

If your domain is on my list and you feel like this is a mistake - feel free to contact me.
