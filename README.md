# blocked_domains
My personal blocklist of domains for DNS based blocking (in my usecase #PiHole).

From time to time I'll add (malicious) domains that I stumple upon.

## Description

- ad_tracking.txt -- tracking or ad-serving domains
- bigcompanies.txt -- domains of big companies that I don't want on my network (update blocking or similar)
- other.txt -- I don't remember the reason - properly also ads, porn, or unwanted products (usenet)

If your domain is on my list and you feel like this is a mistake - feel free to contact me.
